# CorePress backwards compatibility

This is a replacement for backwards compatibility features from Wordpress for CorePress.

The code here is based on the original [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) code.

For CorePress, we decided to move it into a plugin to increase modularity and avoid unnecessary bloat, but still allow users to use legacy plugins.
